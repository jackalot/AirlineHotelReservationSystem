	Prompt: Create a reservation system which books airline seats or hotel rooms. It charges various rates for particular sections of the plane or hotel. Example, first class is going to cost more than coach. Hotel rooms have penthouse suites which cost more. Keep track of when rooms will be available and can be scheduled.
	Plan:
	Create a class called Plane() {
		holds the amount of seats in total
		holds each type of seat

	}
	create an object in a function called Seat {
		holds the rank of the seat
		holds the price
	}
	make a ui list that will show you options on all available seats
	Options:
	* 1 High class
	* 2 Middle class 
	* 3 Low class 
	add a text box to type in how many seats of that type you will be getting of which type
	store in a array(to mimic a database)  the choice the user makes and at what time that user made it using Date().
